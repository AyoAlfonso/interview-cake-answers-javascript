My answers in JavaScript to InterviewCake (https://www.interviewcake.com) Weekly Problems

Each solution can be found in its own directory and generally includes a package containing the guts of the solution
plus a test script that runs through the test cases presented by the Interview Cake assignment.

Solutions:

* 8 'Cake Thief' - Solved using a dynamic programming solution to the unbounded knapsack problem
* 9 'Linked List' - Solved by creating a doubly-linked list (different than InterviewCake proscribed solution)
